# Push_swap

## Overview
**Push_swap** is a project designed to help you develop an optimized sorting algorithm using two stacks (`a` and `b`). The goal is to sort a stack of integers with the fewest number of operations using a restricted set of stack manipulation instructions. The project emphasizes algorithmic rigor and efficiency.

## Features
- Uses stack-based sorting with minimal operations.
- Simulates real-world algorithm challenges, focusing on efficiency.
- Implements a limited set of stack operations (push, swap, rotate, and reverse rotate).

## How to Build
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the project using the provided `Makefile`:
   ```bash
   make
## How To Run
   ```
  ./push_swap [list_of_integers]
  ./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8
